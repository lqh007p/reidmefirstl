This challenge has players analyze a PCAP which contains a mysterious data exfiltration.

Opening up output.pcap we see a lot DNS queries of some peculiar names.

The hostname part of each query contains a chunk of data from a file that has been base58-encoded.  Rather than implement an actual client and server, we generate the PCAPs using the enclosed Python.  Using the scripts, we can encode any file that we want.

The vision for the protocol is that an A record request is made with a chunk of data. The server acknowledges receipt of the chunk by issuing a host record in return.

One of the chunks failed to reach our DNS server, so our client retransmitted it. This is meant to throw players off a little (and, is the reason that we wrote Python to generate the PCAP, we were lazy and didn't want to make a router drop a DNS packet or something stupid).
