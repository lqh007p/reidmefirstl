The Robots are getting smarter, and seem to be using 2FA for some of their
key systems.

What we know so far:
- They seem to be using 920.6125Mhz for their 2FA system
- They are encrypting their pages somehow
- They left a secure paging web interface running at 10.3.32.46:1185

Can you find their 2FA pin?

Good luck!
