To deploy the challenge you'll need:
- a hackrf
- a linux system to run the 2FA pin transmission

Install server.js, hackrfreset.sh, and the compiled usbreset.c code onto your Linux server.

Install gr-mixalot onto said server.

Install pocsagtx_pagememaybe.py onto said server.

Test out gr-mixalot.py with a test page. We used Apollo pagers in the CTF, which support a wide range of frequencies including the ISM band.

Once you are happy, make a cron entry to fire pretty frequently.  Look at 'cron' for this.  Make sure that pages are transmitting frequently.

Next up install node and use npm to install formidable.

Start up server.js on your favorite tcp port (default is tcp/1185). Test it to make sure it works. Ensure all the paths to your scripts are correct: in particular make sure you can access usbreset.sh, and that this can access the compiled usbreset code for resetting the hackrf between transmits. Also make sure the lockfile/semaphore is correct (see /home/krwightm/PageMe/lockfile.lck, might want to change the filename)
